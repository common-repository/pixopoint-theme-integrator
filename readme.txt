Description: This plugin is no longer supported.

Unfortunately, this plugin caused too much confusion amongst users. Only a couple of users actually understood what it's purpose was, and so I am longer intending to support this plugin. At the time of writing this (December 2014), the plugin still worked fine with the latest version of WordPress and probably will do for a long time to come. Feel free to use it, fork it, do whatever you want with it, but please be aware that this is the last iteration I will be making of this particular version.

= Support =

I do not have time to offer support for this plugin sorry. I have been inundated with questions about this plugin, mostly due to confusion over what it does. If you can not figure out how to use this plugin, it is probably not something you need anyway.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= My other software looks strange, what is wrong? =

There is presumably an HTML or CSS issue somewhere in the way that you have done the integration. There is no simple way to provide assistance for this type of thing due to the wide range of themes and coding practices across the many different softwares that this plugin can be used with. You will either need to work out what the problem is yourself or we may be able to do it for you for a small fee. Please <a href="https://geek.hellyer.kiwi/contact/">contact us</a> for further information regarding paid support.

= Does it work for WordPress version x.x.x? =

Probably, but we only intend to actively support the latest version of WordPress.

= Why isn't the plugin in my language? =

The plugin supports localization using PO and MO files. If you provide a translation we are more than happy to include it in future releases. If you've translated the plugin please let us know by posting in our <a href="https://geek.hellyer.kiwi/forum/">support forum</a>.
